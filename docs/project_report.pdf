CHAPTER-1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Basic Description: 
To control and monitor of different activities focused by Present innovations in technology. 
To reach the human needs these are increasingly emerging. Most of this technology is focused on
efficient monitoring and controlling different activities. To monitor and assess the conditions in case
of exceeding the prescribed level of parameters (e.g., CO, Smoke, temperature and Humidity levels)
an efficient environmental monitoring system is needed. In an environment when an object
equipped with sensor devices, then in this case microcontroller and various software applications
becomes a self-defending Self-monitoring and self-controlling environment and it is also called as
smart environment. 
To predict the behavior of a particular area of interest and to collect the data, the Sensor
devices are placed at different locations. The main goal of the this paper is to design and implement
an adequate monitoring system through which the needed parameters are monitored and controlled
remotely by using internet and the data collected from the sensors are stored in the cloud and on the
web browser to project the estimated trend. 
A solution for monitoring the abnormal and CO levels i.e., any parameter value crossing its
threshold value ranges, for example CO levels in air in a particular area exceeding the normal levels
etc., in the environment using wireless embedded computing system is proposed in this paper. The
solution also provides an intelligent remote monitoring for a particular area of interest. In this paper
I also describe a trending results of sensed or collected data with respect to the ordinary as well as
specified ranges of particular parameters. The embedded system enables the user to remotely access
the various parameters and store the data in cloud and this system is an integration of sensor devices
with wireless communication.

1.2 EXISTING SYSTEM WITH MODEL:- 
In today’s world many pollution monitoring systems are designed by considering different 
environmental parameters. Existing system model is presented in figure 1.1 uses Zigbee based
wireless sensor networks to monitor physical and environmental conditions with thousands of
application in different fields. The sensor nodes directly communicated with the moving nodes
deployed on the object of interest which avoided the use of complex routing algorithm but local
computations are very minimal. RFID is a means of storing and retrieving data through
electromagnetic transmission to an RF compatible integrated circuit. It is basically used to track and
label items in supermarkets and manufactories. There are two main components of RFID systems:
tags and readers. A tag has an unique identification (ID) number and a memory which is used to
store additional data such as manufacturer, product type, and environmental factors such as
temperature, humidity, etc. Through Wireless Communication the reader is capable to write and/or
read data to tags., In need of identification or tracking, tags are embedded or attached into objects in
a typical RFID application. RFID tags can be classified into three major categories by their power
source: active tags, passive tags, and semi passive (semi-active) tags are embedded or attached into
objects in a typical RFID application.

Based on shown in figure 2, we have identified a suitable implementation model that
consists of different sensor devices and other modules, their functionalities. In this implementation
model we used Raspberry Pi board with Wi-Fi module is as embedded device for sensing and
storing the data in cloud. Raspberry Pi board consist of analog input pins (A0-A5), digital output
pins (D0- D13), inbuilt ADC and Wi-Fi module connects the embedded device to internet. Sensors
are connected to Raspberry Pi board for monitoring, ADC will convert the corresponding sensor
reading to its digital value and from that value the corresponding environmental parameter will be
evaluated. The Wi-Fi connection has to be established to transfer sensors data to end user and also
send it to the cloud storage for future usage. Before sending the sensed data to cloud, the data will
be processed in MATLAB for analyze and visualize data to end user. The data analysis in
MATLAB makes easier to us to set threshold level and to perform necessary controlling actions.

module.  
It shows the embedded system with its components for reading and to store the pollution 
parameters in cloud. After successful completion of sensing, the data will be processed and stored in
database for future reference. After completing the analysis on data the threshold values will be set
for controlling purpose. 
CO levels in air at regular time intervals. All the above information will be stored in the
cloud, so that we can provide trending of noise intensity and CO levels in a particular area at any
point of time. 
After sensing the data from different sensor devices, which are placed in particular area of
interest. The sensed data will be automatically sent to the web server, when a proper connection is
established with sever device. By entering IP address of server which is placed for monitoring we
will get the corresponding web page. The web page gives the information about the intensity of
sound and the CO level variations in that particular region, where the embedded monitoring system
is placed. The sensed data will be stored in cloud (Google Spread Sheets). The data stored in cloud
can be used for the analysis of the parameter and continuous monitoring purpose.

5.1.2 MQ7 CO GAS SENSOR:- 
Carbon monoxide gas is a very dangerous, harmful, and toxic gas for the normal 
environment. Since the gas has no color and is odorless, so it cannot be smelt or seen. So, if
there is carbon monoxide gas in the surroundings, the person really would get no idea that
they are breathing in CO until he/she feels not safe. So, it is necessary to have detected that
toxic gas. Hence, there is an MQ7 gas detector sensor that can detect this harmful gas.
Below is the complete description of this sensor.

5.1.5 RASPBERRY PI:- 
Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in 
the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The
Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer
science in schools and in developing countries. The original model became more popular
than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used
in many areas, such as for weather monitoring, because of its low cost, modularity, and open
design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of
the HDMI and USB standards.

responsibility of developing technology. The Foundation was rededicated as an educational
charity for promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools and developing

5.1.6 LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY:- 
A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated 
optical device that uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined
with polarizers. Liquid crystals do not emit 
light directly, instead using 
a backlight or reflector to produce images in colour or monochrome. LCDs are available to
display arbitrary images (as in a general-purpose computer display) or fixed images with low
information content, which can be displayed or hidden. For instance: preset words, digits,
and seven-segment displays, as in a digital clock, are all good examples of devices with
these displays. They use the same basic technology, except that arbitrary images are made
from a matrix of small pixels, while other displays have larger elements. LCDs can either be
normally on (positive) or off (negative), depending on the polarizer arrangement. Optical
filters are added to white on blue LCDs to give them their characteristic appearance. 
Specification:- 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5.6: Liquid Crystal Display 
 Resolution The resolution of an LCD is expressed by the number of columns and rows
of pixels (e.g., 1024×768). Each pixel is usually composed 3 sub-pixels, a red, a green,
and a blue one.  
 Spatial performance: For a computer monitor or some other display that is being
viewed from a very close distance, resolution is often expressed in terms of dot pitch or
pixels per inch, which is consistent with the printing industry.  
 Temporal performance: the temporal resolution of an LCD is how well it can display
changing images, or the accuracy and the number of times per second the display draws
the data it is being given.

 Color performance: There are multiple terms to describe different aspects of color
performance of a display. Color gamut is the range of colors that can be displayed, and
color depth, which is the fineness with which the color range is divided.  
 Brightness and contrast ratio: Contrast ratio is the ratio of the brightness of a full-on
pixel to a full-off pixel. The LCD itself is only a light valve and does not generate light;
the light comes from a backlight that is either fluorescent or a set of LEDs. Brightness is
usually stated as the maximum light output of the LCD, which can vary greatly based on
the transparency of the LCD and the brightness of the backlight.

5.1.7 LIGHT EMITTING DIODE:- 
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when 
current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes,
releasing energy in the form of photons (Energy packets). The color of the light
(corresponding to the energy of the photons) is determined by the energy required for
electrons to cross the band gap of the semi-conductor. White light is obtained by using
multiple semiconductors or a layer of light-emitting phosphor on the semiconductor device.

switching rates are useful in advanced communications technology with applications as
diverse as aviation lighting, fairy lights, automotive headlamps, advertising, general lighting,
traffic signals, camera flashes, lighted wallpaper, horticultural grow lights, and medical
devices.

5.1.8 RECTIFIER:- 
A rectifier is an electrical device that converts alternating current (AC), which 
periodically reverses direction, to direct current (DC), which flows in only one direction.
The reverse operation is performed by the inverter.
The process is known as rectification, since it "straightens" the direction of current.
Physically, rectifiers take a number of forms, including vacuum tube diodes, wet chemical
cells, mercury-arc valves, stacks of copper and selenium oxide plates, semiconductor diodes,
silicon-controlled rectifiers and other silicon-based semiconductor switches. Historically,
even synchronous electromechanical switches and motor-generator sets have been used. 










Early radio receivers, called crystal radios, used a "cat's whisker" of fine wire pressing
on a crystal of galena (lead sulfide) to serve as a point-contact rectifier or "crystal detector".
Rectifiers have many uses, but are often found serving as components of DC power supplies
and high-voltage direct current power transmission systems. Rectification may serve in roles
other than to generate direct current for use as a source of power. As noted, detectors of
radio signals serve as rectifiers. In gas heating systems flame rectification is used to detect
presence of a flame.
Depending on the type of alternating current supply and the arrangement of the
rectifier circuit, the output voltage may require additional smoothing to produce a uniform
steady voltage. Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television
and computer equipment, require a steady constant DC voltage (as would be produced by a
battery). In these applications the output of the rectifier is smoothed by an electronic filter,
which may be a capacitor, choke, or set of capacitors, chokes and resistors, possibly
followed by a voltage regulator to produce a steady voltage.

============================================================================= 
5.1.9 RESISTOR:- 
A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical 
resistance as a circuit element. In electronic circuits, resistors are used to reduce current
flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate
transmission lines, among other uses. High-power resistors that can dissipate many watts of
electrical power as heat may be used as part of motor controls, in power distribution
systems, or as test loads for generators. Fixed resistors have resistances that only change
slightly with temperature, time or operating voltage. Variable resistors can be used to adjust
circuit elements (such as a volume control or a lamp dimmer), or as sensing devices for heat,
light, humidity, force, or chemical activity.

















Resistors are common elements of electrical networks and electronic circuits and are
ubiquitous in electronic equipment. Practical resistors as discrete components can be
composed of various compounds and forms. Resistors are also implemented within
integrated circuits.
The electrical function of a resistor is specified by its resistance: common commercial
resistors are manufactured over a range of more than nine orders of magnitude. The nominal
value of the resistance falls within the manufacturing tolerance, indicated on the component.

============================================================================= 
5.1.10  CAPACITOR:- 
A capacitor is a device that stores electrical energy in an electric field. It is a passive 
electronic component with two terminals.
The effect of a capacitor is known as capacitance. While some capacitance exists between
any two electrical conductors in proximity in a circuit, a capacitor is a component designed
to add capacitance to a circuit. The capacitor was originally known as a condenser or
condensator. This name and its cognates are still widely used in many languages, but rarely
in English, one notable exception being condenser microphones, also called capacitor
microphones.









The physical form and construction of practical capacitors vary widely and many types
of capacitor are in common use. Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors
often in the form of metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. A
conductor may be a foil, thin film, sintered bead of metal, or an electrolyte. The
nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials
commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, air, and oxide
layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical
devices. 
Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy, although real-life
capacitors do dissipate a small amount (see Non-ideal behavior). When an electric potential
difference (a voltage) is applied across the terminals of a capacitor, for example when a
capacitor is connected across a battery, an electric field develops across the dielectric,
causing a net positive charge to collect on one plate and net negative charge to collect on the
other plate. No current actually flows through the dielectric. However, there is a flow of
charge through the source circuit. If the condition is maintained sufficiently long, the current
through the source circuit ceases.

5.1.11  REGULATOR 7805 IC:- 
78xx (sometimes L78xx, LM78xx, MC78xx...) is a family of self-contained fixed linear 
voltage regulator integrated circuits. The 78xx family is commonly used in electronic
circuits requiring a regulated power supply due to their ease-of-use and low cost. 
For ICs within the 78xx family, the xx is replaced with two digits, indicating the 
output voltage (for example, the 7805 has a 5-volt output, while the 7812 produces 12 volts).
The 78xx line are positive voltage regulators: they produce a voltage that is positive relative
to a common ground. There is a related line of 79xx devices which are complementary
negative voltage regulators. 78xx and 79xx ICs can be used in combination to provide
positive and negative supply voltages in the same circuit.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5.11: Regulator  
 
These devices support an input voltage anywhere from around 2.5 volts over the 
intended output voltage up to a maximum of 35 to 40 volts depending on the model, and
typically provide 1 or 1.5 amperes of current (though smaller or larger packages may have a
lower or higher current rating).  
There are common configurations for 78xx ICs, including 7805 (5 V), 7806 (6 V), 
7808 (8 V), 7809 (9 V), 7810 (10 V), 7812 (12 V), 7815 (15 V), 7818 (18 V), and 7824 (24
V) versions. The 7805 is the most common, as its regulated 5-volt supply provides a
convenient power source for most TTL components. 
Less common are lower-power versions such as the LM78Mxx series (500 mA) and 
LM78Lxx series (100 mA) from National Semiconductor. Some devices provide slightly
different voltages than usual, such as the LM78L62 (6.2 volts) and LM78L82 (8.2 volts) as
well as the STMicroelectronics L78L33ACZ (3.3 volts).

5.1.12  PRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD:- 
A printed circuit board (PCB) or printed wiring board (PWB) is a laminated sandwich 
structure of conductive and insulating layers. PCBs have two complementary functions. The
first is to affix electronic components in designated locations on the outer layers by means of
soldering. The second is to provide reliable electrical connections (and also reliable open
circuits) between the component's terminals in a controlled manner often referred to as PCB
design. Each of the conductive layers is designed with an artwork pattern of conductors
(similar to wires on a flat surface) that provides electrical connections on that conductive
layer. Another manufacturing process adds vias, plated-through holes that allow
interconnections between layers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig 5.12: Printed Circuit Board 
 
PCBs mechanically support electronic components using conductive pads in the shape 
designed to accept the component's terminals, and also electrically connect them using
traces, planes and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated

============================================================================= 
onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate. Components are generally
soldered onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it. 
Printed circuit boards are used in nearly all electronic products. Alternatives to PCBs 
include wire wrap and point-to-point construction, both once popular but now rarely used.
PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly
can be automated. Electronic computer-aided design software is available to do much of the
work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other
wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation. Large numbers of
PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout only has to be done once. PCBs can
also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits. 
PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on 
both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper,
alternating with layers of substrate). Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component
density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space
between components. The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and
especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of surface
mount technology. However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification
of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.

CHAPTER-6
WORKING OF THE PROJECT 
In view of the daily chores of a household the monitoring of real time parameters is highly 
beneficial for the sustenance of an organized and well informed standard of living. The parameters we are
dealing here are different gases, dust, room temperatures and humidity present required for an ambient
living. The respective sensors are being utilized for acquisition of the required data to be monitored. DHT11
sensor has been used to monitor the room temperature and pressure. It is a 4 pins sensor of which 2 pins
uses I2C protocol (SCL and SDA) which are connected to the respective I2C protocol supported pins on the
Raspberry Pi. It is based on the piezo resistive technology. The parameters are then send to the Controller.
MQ-2 sensor is a gas sensor which can detect the presence of combustible gases such as i-butane, LPG,
hydrogen & methane. In this project, it is used mainly for detecting household LPG. The ionized
constituents are detected by the sensing element, which creates a potential difference thus giving output in
the form of current. 
The concentration of the gas detected is then send to the Raspberry Pi. It has both the analog and
the digital output but here we use the analog output which is connected to the analog pin of the controller.
DHT11 sensor is used for measuring humidity and temperature of the surroundings. The sensor provides
fully calibrated digital outputs for the measurements of the parameters. It sends a data of 40 bits both for
the temperature and humidity which also includes the checksum byte (bit error check). It operates at a
voltage of +5v and gives the digital output connected to any of the digital pin of the controller. The MQ-135
gas sensor senses the gases like CO2, ammonia nitrogen, oxygen, alcohols, aromatic compounds, sulfide
and smoke. The operating voltage of this gas sensor is from 2.5V to 5.0V. In the atmosphere we can find
polluting gases, but the conductivity of gas sensor increases as the concentration of polluting gas increases.
MQ-7 smoke sensor can be implementation to detect the smoke, benzene, steam and other harmful gases.
It has potential to detect different harmful gases. The MQ-7 smoke sensor is low cost to purchase.
Raspberry pi module is a Wi-Fi module, which the backbone of this project. Here it is used for connecting
the Controller to an access point (Wi-Fi). This module has inbuilt set of Attention Commands which are
required to configure the module. 
Firstly we flash the Raspberry Pi module using the software then using the Attention Commands it
is set in the Wi-Fi mode and then it is connected to a mobile hotspot or a Wi-Fi, which finally connects our
microcontroller to the Wi_Fi. We create a channel (private) to view the changes in the parameters. 
The data is displayed graphically on the channel. One can get the access to the channel by getting
the user ID and the data is transmitted to the channel by using the write API key provided by the channel,
which enables our microcontroller to send the data. It requires a time of 15ms to update the data.
Raspberry Pi takes input from the sensors and is connected to the Wi-Fi with the help of the Wi-Fi module
which enable it to transmit data to the channel. The whole processing required is done by the processor in

it. Starting with this project, first of all we flash the memory of the Wi-Fi module (Raspberry) to avoid any
garbage values in our readings, then moving on to the next step we use some AT commands to set the
module in the Wi-Fi mode and search for the available access points and then connect to any of them. If the
module gets connected, it is well and good otherwise go back to the basic AT Commands then retry to
connect which connects our Controller to the Wi- Fi. 
Then the next step is for taking inputs from the respective sensors in the Controller, now after
obtaining values from the sensors, we need to convert the 5 volt logic of Raspberry Pi to the 3.3 volt logic as
the Wi-Fi module works in 3.3 volt logic, after doing that use the channel API key to transmit the data/ input
from the sensor to the channel and display them graphically on the space provided by the channel and for
more understanding the whole process has been depicted. In this the components used in the project are
represented in the form of blocks and shows how we carried out our work. First of all using all the 4 types
of sensors we collected data then this data is latched in the Raspberry Pi, then after performing all the basic
requirements required by the Wi-Fi module, we connect our Controller to the access point and then finally
we upload the data to the channel.

CONCLUSION 
To implement this need to deploy the sensor devices in the environment   for   collecting   
the   data   and   analysis. 
 
By deploying sensor devices in the environment, we can bring the environment into real life 
i.e. it can interact with other objects through  the network.  Then  the  collected data and  analysis
results will be available to the end user through the Wi-Fi. The smart way to monitor environment
and an efficient, low cost embedded system is presented with different models in this paper. The
noise and air pollution monitoring system with Internet of Things (IoT) concept experimentally
tested for monitoring two parameters. This model can be further expanded to monitor the
developing cities and industrial zones for pollution monitoring. To protect the public health from
pollution, this model provides an efficient and low cost solution for continuous monitoring of
environment.
