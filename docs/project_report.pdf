Detailed Project Report 
 
Real-time • Safety-first • Raspberry Pi ready • Dockerized • Open-source

1. **Introduction** 
 
 
Industrial environments such as manufacturing plants, warehouses, refineries, and power facilities are exposed to
continuous safety risks. Fire outbreaks, toxic gas leaks, excessive heat, and poor environmental conditions can
result in equipment damage, production downtime, and loss of human life. Traditional safety systems are often
reactive, fragmented, and lack centralized visibility. 
 
The need for real-time monitoring has become critical as industries scale and operate continuously. Internet of
Things (IoT) based automation enables continuous sensing, intelligent decision-making, and rapid response. This
project implements a modern Industrial IoT Security Automation platform designed to detect hazards early and
provide live operational awareness.

2. Objectives 
 
 
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a real-time industrial safety monitoring system
using loT principles. The specific objectives include: 
 
- Continuous real-time sensing of environmental and safety parameters
- Automated alert generation for warning and critical conditions
- Live monitoring dashboard for operators and safety teams
- Edge and cloud ready system architecture
- Open-source, modular, and extensible design

3. System Architecture 
 
 
The system follows a stream-based loT pipeline inspired by real industrial telemetry systems. Sensor data flows 
continuously from edge devices to the backend services where it is validated, processed, stored, and visualized.
The architecture diagram is provided in architecture.png. 
 
The backend service handles sensor ingestion, threshold evaluation, data persistence, and alerting. The
dashboard provides real-time visualization of sensor values and alerts. A simulator is included to generate test
telemetry for development and validation.

4. Technology Stack 
 
 
Sensors: Flame sensor, CO/Gas sensor, Smoke sensor, DHT temperature and humidity sensor
Backend: Python, FastAPI framework
Frontend: React.js based dashboard
Deployment: Docker and Docker Compose 
Edge Devices: Raspberry Pi and compatible microcontrollers
 
5. Implementation Details 
 
 
Sensor data is ingested via HTTP REST endpoints in JSON format. Each reading includes a device ID, sensor
type, value, and timestamp. Incoming data is validated for correctness and evaluated against predefined safety
thresholds. 
 
When a threshold breach is detected, alerts are generated and forwarded to external alert channels such as email,
SMS, and webhooks. The frontend dashboard periodically polls the backend to display live sensor data and alert
information.

6. Results 
 
 
The system successfully demonstrates real-time ingestion of sensor data and immediate alert generation for
unsafe conditions. The live dashboard provides operators with continuous visibility into environmental
conditions and system health. 
 
During testing, simulated sensor data triggered warning and critical alerts as expected. The modular design
ensures the system can be extended with minimal effort.

7. Advantages 
 
 
- Real-time monitoring and alerting
- Modular and maintainable architecture
- Scalable from small plants to large facilities
- Cost-effective open-source solution
- Edge and cloud deployment flexibility

8. Future Enhancements 
 
 
Future enhancements include WebSocket-based real-time data push, integration with time-series databases
such as lnfluxDB or TimescaleDB, cloud-native alerting services, and machine
learning-based anomaly detection for predictive safety monitoring.
 
9. Conclusion
