1. Introduction

Industrial environments face safety risks such as fire, gas leaks, and overheating. IoT-based
real-time monitoring enables early detection and rapid response.

2. Objectives

Real-time sensing, automated alerts, live monitoring dashboard, and edge + cloud readiness.

3. System Architecture

Sensor data flows to the FastAPI backend, threshold logic evaluates risk, alerts are generated, and data is visualized 
on a React dashboard.

4. Technology Stack

Sensors: Flame, CO, Smoke, DHT | Backend: FastAPI (Python) | Frontend: React | Deployment: Docker | Edge: Raspberry Pi

5. Implementation Details

REST-based sensor ingestion, threshold evaluation, alert service, and dashboard polling.

6. Results

Successful real-time data ingestion, alert triggering, and live dashboard visualization.

7. Advantages

Real-time, modular, scalable, and cost-effective design.

8. Future Enhancements

WebSockets, InfluxDB, cloud notifications, and ML-based anomaly detection.

9. Conclusion

The project demonstrates a practical and extensible industrial IoT security solution.
